## Built With üõ†

- [React-Native](https://reactnative.dev/) - React Native brings React's declarative UI framework to iOS and Android. With React Native, you use native UI controls and have full access to the native platform.
- [RTK Query](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/rtk-query/overview) RTK Query is a powerful data fetching and caching tool. It is designed to simplify common cases for loading data in a web application, eliminating the need to hand-write data fetching & caching logic yourself.
- [Axios](https://axios-http.com/) - Axios is a simple promise based HTTP client for the browser and node.js. Axios provides a simple to use library in a small package with a very extensible interface.
- [Redux-toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) - The official, opinionated, batteries-included toolset for efficient Redux development
- [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) - Redux is an open-source JavaScript library for managing and centralizing application state. It is most commonly used with libraries such as React or Angular for building user interfaces.
- [React-Navigation 7](https://reactnavigation.org/) - Routing and navigation for your React Native apps.
- [Zustand](https://zustand-demo.pmnd.rs/) - A small, fast and scalable bearbones state-management solution using simplified flux principles. Has a comfy API based on hooks, isn't boilerplatey or opinionated.
- [react-native-mmkv](https://github.com/mrousavy/react-native-mmkv) - ‚ö°Ô∏è The fastest key/value storage for React Native. ~30x faster than AsyncStorage!
